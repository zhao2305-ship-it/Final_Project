    <h1>Final Project – Water Pinball</h1>
    <p class="muted">
      A real-time 3D water simulation combined with a small pinball-style game.
    </p>

    <div class="box">
      <h2>What this project is about</h2>
      <p>
        This project started as a simple water surface simulation. The main idea was to show how water moves over time,
        how light creates highlights on the surface, and how objects under the water look distorted.
      </p>
      <p>
        While working on it, I realized that a purely visual demo looks nice but is not always very engaging to watch.
        To make the project more interesting and easier to demonstrate, I turned it into a small interactive game.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the final version, the water surface reacts directly to gameplay events. A ball is launched into the scene,
        and every time it hits a wall or the center cube, it creates strong ripples on the water. The goal is to get the
        ball into the exit area within 15 seconds.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
      <h2>How to interact</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Mouse left drag: rotate the camera</li>
        <li>Mouse wheel: zoom in and out</li>
        <li>Left / Right arrow keys: adjust launch angle (before launch)</li>
        <li><code>Enter</code>: launch the ball or restart</li>
        <li><code>R</code>: reset the game</li>
        <li><code>1</code> / <code>2</code> / <code>3</code>: change wave strength</li>
        <li><code>ESC</code>: quit</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        Win condition: reach the exit zone within 15 seconds.  
        Lose condition: time runs out.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
      <h2>Connection to the class</h2>
      <p>
        This project uses several concepts discussed in class. The water animation is time-based and updated every frame.
        The rendering is done with OpenGL using custom GLSL vertex and fragment shaders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Basic lighting models are used for both the water surface and the ball, including diffuse and specular lighting.
        The underwater image is sampled as a texture and distorted based on the water motion, which creates a
        refraction-like effect.
      </p>

      <h2>Files and build</h2>
      <p>
        Required files:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>simple_water.cpp</code></li>
        <li><code>Hachimi.bmp</code> (must be in the same folder)</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="muted">Build and run (Windows, MSYS2 UCRT64):</p>
      <pre>
cd /d/Final_project
g++ simple_water.cpp -o water.exe ^
  -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lglew32 -lopengl32
./water.exe
      </pre>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
      <h2>Future ideas</h2>
      <p>
        If I had more time, I would like to improve the realism of the water by adding better reflections or more detailed
        surface motion. From the gameplay side, more obstacles or levels could also make the interaction more interesting.
