    <!-- ================= Title ================= -->
    <h1>Final Project – Real-Time Water Surface & Caustics</h1>
    <p class="muted">
      A real-time OpenGL scene focusing on animated water, lighting, and caustic effects.
    </p>

    <!-- ================= Project Description ================= -->
    <div class="box">
      <h2>Project Description</h2>

      <p>
        I am working on this final project by myself. The original goal of this project was
        to create a small real-time scene with a moving water surface. The water rises and
        falls over time, shows bright highlights, and changes its appearance depending on
        the viewing angle, similar to a real lake.
      </p>

      <p>
        When viewed from the side, the water appears more reflective, and when viewed from
        above, it becomes more transparent. Under the water surface, I placed a simple
        ground plane where I aimed to show the soft, moving light patterns that appear when
        sunlight passes through water.
      </p>

      <p>
        The entire project is built using OpenGL and GLSL shaders. Since the focus is on
        water motion, reflections, transparency, and caustics, the final visual result is
        intentionally very different from any previous assignments in the course.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- ================= Progress ================= -->
    <div class="box">
      <h2>Progress Update and Development Direction</h2>

      <p>
        At the midpoint of the project, the core structure was already in place. I had a
        working rendering framework and a subdivided plane that acted as the water surface.
        This plane was animated using time-based wave functions, allowing the surface to
        move smoothly over time.
      </p>

      <p>
        I added basic lighting so the water surface could show moving highlights as the
        waves shift. A simple Fresnel effect was also implemented, making the water more
        reflective at shallow angles and clearer when viewed from above.
      </p>

      <p>
        At that stage, the underwater ground plane was visible, and I began working on
        animated caustics. While the caustics were functional, they initially appeared
        rough and required further refinement.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the project developed further, I expanded the original visual demo into a more
        interactive scene. To better demonstrate how the water reacts to dynamic objects,
        I added a small pinball-style interaction. Moving objects collide with boundaries
        and obstacles, and each collision produces strong ripples on the water surface.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- ================= Challenges ================= -->
    <div class="box">
      <h2>Challenges and Concerns</h2>

      <p>
        One major concern during development was surface normal calculation. If the
        normals are not computed smoothly, reflections and highlights can flicker or look
        unstable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another challenge was tuning the caustic patterns. Caustics can easily become too
        bright or move too quickly, which breaks the illusion of realistic water. Finding
        the right balance took several iterations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Performance was also an important consideration. A dense water mesh combined with
        multiple wave components can reduce frame rate, so I needed to balance visual
        quality with real-time performance.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- ================= Expected Result ================= -->
    <div class="box">
      <h2>Expected Result</h2>

      <p>
        The intended final result is a scene that feels like shallow, clear water. The
        upper part of the scene shows a moving water surface with waves and shifting
        reflections. Beneath the surface, the ground remains visible, and soft caustic
        light patterns move slowly across it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Overall, the scene is meant to feel calm and believable, allowing the viewer to
        clearly observe how light, motion, and geometry interact in a water environment.
